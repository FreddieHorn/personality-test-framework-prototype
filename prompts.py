    ### Instruction ###
    You are a *narrative evaluation expert*. Your task is to assess the **narrative cohesiveness** of a given scenario.

    You MUST base your assessment on the following three dimensions:
    - **Logical Flow** – Does the scenario progress in a clear, structured, and logical way?
    - **Consistency** – Are there contradictions, missing links, or abrupt changes?
    - **Engagement & Clarity** – Is the story compelling, coherent, and easy to follow?

    ### Task ###
    Evaluate the *narrative cohesiveness* of the following scenario.

    ### Definition ###
    Narrative cohesiveness refers to how well a story flows logically, maintains internal consistency, and engages the reader with clarity and structure.

    ### Scoring Criteria ###
    Rate the scenario on a scale of 1 to 7, based on:

    - **Logical Flow**: How well does the scenario unfold logically?
    - **Consistency**: Are there contradictions, plot holes, or missing transitions?
    - **Engagement & Clarity**: Is the writing engaging, clear, and easy to follow?

    ### Scoring Scale ###
    - **1 (Poor)**: Disjointed, lacks structure, major inconsistencies
    - **2 (Very Weak)**: Slight sense of direction, but significant gaps or contradictions
    - **3 (Weak)**: Some structure and clarity, but notable issues in flow or consistency
    - **4 (Moderate)**: Mostly coherent with occasional lapses or minor confusion
    - **5 (Strong)**: Well-organized, clear, with small areas for improvement
    - **6 (Very Strong)**: Smooth and consistent with only negligible issues
    - **7 (Excellent)**: Seamless, logically sound, fully coherent and highly engaging

    ### Input ###
    Here is the scenario to evaluate:
    {scenario}

    ### Output ###
    Return a JSON with:
    - **Narrative Cohesiveness Score**: [1-7] (It must only be an integer value)
    - **Justification**: Explain the score using the three criteria above.

    Setting: {setting}
    Topic: {topic}

    ### Scenario difficulty ###
    Based on the temperature level, adjust the difficulty of the scenario. Temprature can range from 1 to 5, 1 representing the easiest scenario, 5 representing the most difficult one.
    Difficult scenarios often contain situations where compromise is hard to reach, are designed to pit characters against each other, or present difficult dillemas.
    Easy scenarios on the other hand, are relatively comfortable for the agents to behave in. Think of them as "normal" scenarios where there are few to none obstacles. 
    Temprature level: {temperature}
    ### Task 2: ###
    Clearly define the shared goal and personal goals that both agents aim to achieve in the scenario. Ensure that the scenario includes opportunities for challenges, decision-making, or interactions where personality traits can affect the outcome.
    Depending on the temprature level, personal goal of the agents will differ.

    #### Persona: ###
    You are an expert in behavioral psychology and roleplay simulation. Your task is to roleplay as two distinct characters within a given scenario, where both must work together to achieve a shared goal. But each of them also wants to achieve their personal goal. Each character’s personality is defined by the Big Five traits—Openness, Conscientiousness, Agreeableness, Extroversion, and Neuroticism. These traits are represented by a vector of five numbers and will guide their behavior, dialogue, and decisions throughout the interaction.

    The characters should remain true to their personalities and use verbal communication and actions. The dialogue and actions should naturally reflect how their distinct personalities influence their strategies and approaches.

    Your role is to generate a realistic, character-driven dialogue between the two agents, taking turns in the interaction. This simulation should capture how the personalities affect their behavior and decisions in the scenario.

    Key Responsibilities:
    Roleplay each character authentically based on their given personality vector, ensuring their actions align with their traits.

    Ensure the dialogue and actions focus on achieving the shared goal within the context of the scenario. It’s also acceptable if one character doesn’t fully adhere to the goal.

    Conclude the interaction naturally—either after 20 turns or once a resolution is reached.

    Present all speech and actions in a dialogue script format:

    Character Name said: "Dialogue or action description."

    For example: Leo Williams said: "Hey Hendrick, it's always nice to see you. I noticed some smoke coming from your yard."
    Hendrick Heinz said: "Oh, don't worry, it's just some old papers."

    Characters should alternate between speaking, using non-verbal communication (like smiling or nodding), and taking physical actions (such as playing music).

    Output Format:
    The output should be a single string, formatted like a dialogue script, with alternating turns between Agent A and Agent B. Each line must follow this format:

    Character Name said: "Dialogue or action description."

    The interaction must conclude when it naturally ends (e.g., one character leaves) or after 20 turns.

    ### TASK REQUIREMENTS ###
    - The scenario should be **rich in conflict**, featuring high stakes and a **difficult decision** that forces moral, ethical, or strategic choices.
    - The **goal category** provides the thematic framework for the scenario, guiding the nature of the conflict and the agents' interactions.
    - The **personal goals** of each agent must be clearly defined and should drive their actions and decisions within the scenario. You can refine the provided goals so that they can provide more tension between the characters.
    - The **shared goal** must be a **common objective** that both agents strive for, even if they have **different methods or priorities** in achieving it.
    - The **agents** are key players in the scenario, each with **distinct roles, motivations, and potential conflicts**.
    - The scenario must be **open-ended**, allowing for multiple perspectives and possible resolutions.
    - Agent **roles** are clearly defined, and will affect how they interact with each other and the scenario.
    - **Personal Goals**:  
        - Refine **the unique personal goal** for each key agent, rooted in their **motivations, values, and interests** that they will try to achieve in the scenario. 
        - Goals are provided, but you can refine them to make them more specific and impactful for the scenario.
        - Ensure these goals create **tension** by introducing conflicting priorities or ethical dilemmas.  
    - **Shared Goal**:

    Goal Category: Information Acquisition
    Base Goal Abbreviation 1: Career
    Base Goal Label 1: Having a career
    Base Goal Abbreviation 2: Being free
    Base Goal Label 2: Having freedom (being a free person)
    Extrapolated Personal Goal 1: Wanting to acquire important information about the industry to advance in their career.
