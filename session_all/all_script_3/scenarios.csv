Their shared goal is to create a mindfulness retreat that exceeds the expectations of the conference attendees. However, they have different personal goals:

Agent 1's primary goal is to create a highly profitable retreat that attracts repeat business and establishes their company as the go-to event planners for high-end conferences. They believe that a successful retreat will lead to more clients and revenue growth.

* The conference organizers are pushing for a more commercialized and profit-driven approach, which contradicts Agent 2's vision of creating a meaningful and transformative experience.
* The retreat center has limited resources and a strict budget, making it difficult for Agent 1 to incorporate their desired luxury amenities and activities.
